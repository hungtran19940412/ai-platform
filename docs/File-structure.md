## File Connections and Interactions

### Data Flow
1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Raw data → Data validation → Preprocessing → Feature engineering
   - Financial data → Analysis → Insights generation
   - Support data → Processing → Model training

2. **Model Training**
   - Processed data → Model training → Model evaluation → Deployment
   - Feedback data → Model retraining → Versioning

3. **API Flow**
   - Request → Authentication → Service routing → Response
   - Recommendation requests → Engine processing → Personalized results
   - Financial queries → Analysis → Insights generation
   - Support queries → NLP processing → Automated responses

4. **Monitoring**
   - System metrics → Collection → Visualization → Alerting
   - Model performance → Tracking → Reporting → Optimization
