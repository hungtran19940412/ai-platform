## Component Interaction

### Data Flow
1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data is collected and stored in `data/raw/`
2. **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned and processed, stored in `data/processed/`
3. **Model Training**: Processed data is used to train models in `models/`
4. **Inference**: The API (`src/api/`) uses trained models to generate predictions

### API Interaction
1. **User Request**: Sent to the API, which routes it to the appropriate service
2. **Data Validation**: Input data is validated using scripts in `data/validation/`
3. **Model Processing**: Request is processed by the appropriate model
4. **Response Generation**: Formatted response is returned to the user

### Monitoring and Logging
1. **Performance Tracking**: Metrics collected by `src/monitoring/`
2. **Alerting**: Anomalies trigger alerts through monitoring system
3. **Logging**: All interactions are logged for analysis and debugging
